
Constraints in persistence like below to related table to make possible to create tables not form sql file but from ORM layer
sql usually depends by data base engine, ORM should provide possibility to change db without changing any db models and constraints

@Entity
@Table(name = "user_roles", catalog = "db_jv_crm", uniqueConstraints = @UniqueConstraint(columnNames = { "role", "username" }))
